# Simple Interactive Feature

This repository contains a solution for the **Simple Interactive Feature** task, where an HTML page with a button allows users to change the text of a heading when clicked. The page also includes basic CSS for styling and a polished user experience.

## Problem Statement

Create a small HTML page with the following features:
1. A button that, when clicked, changes the text of a heading (use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM).
2. Add some basic CSS to style the page and button.
3. Ensure the page looks presentable (although it doesn't need to be extensively styled, just functional).

## Solution

- **HTML**: Contains a heading (`<h1>`) and a button (`<button>`).
- **CSS**: Basic styles for the page and button to make them visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Implements functionality to change the heading text when the button is clicked using `addEventListener` and `textContent`.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KyathiY/interactive_feature_task
